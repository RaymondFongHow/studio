                                    that emerge after storms. With that, I'm thrilled to

                            <p>In the timely spring rain, all creatures are nourished, 
                                awakening from their slumber. People marvel at the 
                                gentle drizzle and praise the might of the deluge. 
                                Standing in rain, I found myself pondering: how would rain 
                                appear through my lens? What other forms does it take? 
                                In Singapore, where four seasons are absent, how does 
                                rain possess its own unique charm? How would the falling 
                                raindrops stir the depths of people's minds? These 
                                musings inspired me to curate a collection of photographs 
                                taken over the past two years, capturing the essence of 
                                rain in all its forms - be it the falling rain, the 
                                lively splashes and ripples of raindrops, the graceful 
                                dance of snow, or the ephemeral beauty of rainbows 
                                that emerge after storms. With that, I'm thrilled to
